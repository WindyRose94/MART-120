    <p>My eyes snapped open. Why was it so hard to move my head? Where was I? I tried opening my eyes. Well at least that was easy. I cracked them open. No reason to tell enemies I was awake; if there were any around anyway. Slowly the room came into view. It looked like a nursery. Why would I be in a nursery? I slowly looked around. I was in some sort of cage, but there was no roof. I could easily climb out. Why wasn't there a roof. Well I had no reason to question stupid kidnappers cages, so I started to sit up. Tried anyway. Why was it so hard? Did they drug me? What did they do? I tried to think back to the last thing I saw. A white flash. A white flash was the last thing I saw.
        Hearing a noise to my right I turned to see a baby boy. The weird thing was that he was the same size as me. Suddenly it all made sense. The cage, the room, the little boy sleeping next to me. I was a baby again. I did the only thing any person in my position would do. I let out a cry of surprise. The next thing I know I am being lifted up by a man that has a concerned loving look in his eye. The man looked to be in his thirties with a clean shaved face and dark brown hair that was combed back away from his eyes. I stared at the man. Something was familiar about him. Then I heard a voice by the door.
        “Is she alright dad?” Questioned the child. He couldn't have been more than five years old. He had curly brown hair that hung down to his chin. He had bright green eyes that also held the loving concern that I had seen in the man.
        “Yes. She is fine.” He spoke looking at the boy. Then he turned back to me. “Something must have startled her. I mean she seems fine now that we are here.” The whole time the man had been talking I was trying to figure out why he looked so familiar. Where had I seen him before? Then it hit me. Dad. This was my dad. I never got to know the man well because he had died in a car crash when I was about the boy's age; but after experiencing what world my family lived in I felt that was a lie. Wait, the boy had called dad, “dad”. I took a closer look at him. It was him. My oldest brother, Josh. No way. He had died in a fire that was started by less than normal beings. They were both here. That meant. I looked down at the baby boy. This was my twin Rin. I never knew Rin. He was taken the day of our first birthday and I was too young to remember him. My father and brother died trying to find him. Maybe this time I could stop that from happening? Stop them from ever having to experience the weird world that we live in. What exactly was living in those shadows.
        “So, Rina, What woke you up?” My father asked. That's right my name is Rina. My mother named me that before she died of complications of childbirth. Nothing I could change there, but I could stop that thing from taking my brother once again. I would have to train and keep an eye out for something out of place, but for now I had to act like a happy baby girl that I currently, physically was.
    I looked up at my father and clapped my hands together with a giggle.
